SIG – Smart Elderly Walker  This project aims to develop the set of technologies to achieve convenient-to-use mobility support for daily use of the elderly. In this project, we are developing a smart elderly walker which is intended to play an active role in an elderly person’s daily life, with three fundamental functionalities that do not exist or not well supported by (smart) walkers in the market: smart walking assistance; falling prevention and support; autonomous mobility. A set of mechanical, control, sensory, and AI technologies is being developed including: (1) novel walker mechanical structure with omnidirectional mobility and outrigger mechanisms; (2) dual-mode actuation and control for walking/standing support and fall prevention/ recovery; (3) multimodal sensory data collection through soft sensory skin, and data processing on device and in the cloud, for event detection and control such as user front following and fall detection; (4) sound-source localization for elderly localisation and auto-navigation of walker. SIG – BREED Robotics  BREED is a student group committed to developing and promoting bio-inspired technology. Our flagship VAYU project – the world’s fastest robotic fish – and our upcoming initiatives such as our robotic dog aim to educate and enhance awareness in the general student body. Using designs perfected by millions of years of natural evolution, we adapt selected features into increasing effectiveness of man-made robots. We aim to establish a hub based in the Innovation Wing where this development can take root in the local community, increasing awareness and interest while promoting scientific innovation: this will be done through outreach projects, educational initiatives, as well as the continuation of various bio-inspired initiatives under BREED. SIG – HKU RoboMaster  Robomaster is a national robotics competition for university students, hosted by DJI. The project is about forming a team to design various types of smart robots which can engage in face-to-face, videogame-style battles. The preparation process involves the knowledge in the following disciplines: mechanical and hardware design, control theory application, computer vision and smart algorithm, technical management. The ultimate purpose of the project is to develop the skills, quality and team spirit of engineering students that can be beneficial in their future career.

SIG – Quantum Bit Demonstrator  The world is currently in the midst of a second-quantum revolution, which will see the counter intuitive properties of quantum systems such as superposition and entanglement, being applied for commercial technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications. Quantum Computing is mostly taught to undergraduates in a classroom focusing mostly on theoretical and mathematical concepts with minimal laboratory components. This is primarily because research laboratories working in quantum science are too expensive, bulky, and complicated to be used for undergraduate teaching purposes. We wish to bridge that gap by building a compact, user-friendly, interactive setup to introduce quantum physics to a younger non-expert audience. The goal of the project is to create a curriculum for quantum technology, a sustainable education model, with an in-class demonstration kit for quantum science education. SIG – Engineering and Archaeology  We are forming a new interest group at the Innovation Wing, as a collaboration with humanities and educational researchers at HKU.  In this group, we plan to pursue several interdisciplinary projects that will improve the ways we can study and teach about the human past. Our projects will include uses of augmented and virtual reality in recording, teaching, and presenting archaeological sites. We are also studying the use of machine learning and computer vision for several purposes to study visual datasets such as satellite images of ancient landscapes. We work with a field project that travels to Armenia each summer to excavate. We welcome anyone who would like to join our team, from any Faculty. We especially invite engineers and computer scientists, but we also have many other projects which anyone with an interest can join. Let’s learn about the human past together! Thank you! SIG – HKU Astar (formerly RoboMaster ICRA AI Challenge)  HKU Astar is a student group who participates in Robomaster University AI Challenge Competition. Robomaster University AI Challenge is an AI-based robotics competition for university students held by DJI and IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation. It emphasizes on writing AI algorithms and tuning and choosing and training machine learning models to power pure automatic robots to accomplish complex goals like building maps, avoiding collision and tracking. Our team aims to build AI Robot tuples that can work purely automatically. Implementing and design decision policies according to competition requirements. Training AI networks to recognize and track objects. Implement localization and motion planning on robots under uncertainty.  '),\n",

       "  'SIG – IIIs for VIPs  IIIs for VIPs is an SIG collaborating with our supervisor Dr. Joseph Chan. It aims to provide a space where students can create inventions which help improve the daily lives of visually impaired persons (VIPs). We welcome students from engineering, medicine and interested students from other faculties. Our SIG will support our members in finishing their projects until it becomes available for public use. Any project with the purpose of improving the activities of daily living for VIPs are welcome. SIG – PERfECT Wearables for Digital Health  Internet of things (IoT) has attracted huge attention because of its potential to connect things together with the cloud. Similarly, the Internet of Health (IoH) aims to enable real-time health evaluation of an individual or a group with advanced medical devices. This feat can be realized by developing tiny wearable biosensors that can be easily deployed on the human body to monitor health signals. This project develops next-generation wearable biosensors to allow digital healthcare. There are two main components. First, we develop skin-attachable biosensors which detect health signals including electrophysiological signals, temperature, and antibodies or glucose in the sweat. Second, we develop miniaturized sensor characterization systems to enable comfort wear for practical applications. The whole set can communicate the data wirelessly with other electronic devices. This will be one of the smallest wearable devices developed so far. Future research is being conducted by our group at the innovation wing now at HKU.  SIG – HKU Robocon  The annual Robocon competition project allows HKU engineering students from different disciplines to design and fabricate innovative robots with an integration of various advanced technologies, including IoT sensors, AI, computer vision, and mobile computing. Besides, it provides hands-on experiences on product design, prototyping, CNC machining, design and fabrication of electric circuit and PCB, control program development, etc.  Membership  • Membership of Innovation Wing, once approved, will be effective until graduation. • Only registered members of Innovation Wing are permitted to access to its facilities, equipment and services with his/her HKU student/staff card. • Please go through the following three steps (namely Registration, Deposit Payment, and General Safety Training) before granting access to the Innovation Wing.

      "The_Innovation_Wings-2.pdf: life, with three fundamental functionalities that do not exist or not well supported by (smart) walkers in the market: smart walking assistance; falling prevention and support; autonomous mobility. A set of mechanical, control, sensory, and AI technologies is being developed including: (1) novel walker mechanical structure with omnidirectional mobility and outrigger mechanisms; (2) dual-mode actuation and control for walking/standing support and fall prevention/ recovery; (3) multimodal sensory data collection through soft sensory skin, and data processing on device and in the cloud, for event detection and control such as user front following and fall detection; (4) sound-source localization for elderly localisation and auto-navigation of walker. SIG – BREED Robotics  BREED is a student group committed to developing and promoting bio-inspired technology. Our flagship VAYU project – the world’s fastest robotic fish – and our upcoming initiatives such as our robotic dog aim to educate and enhance awareness in the general student body. Using designs perfected by millions of years of natural evolution, we adapt selected features into increasing effectiveness of man-made robots.\n",
      "The_Innovation_Wings-1.pdf:  Not only to gain a lot of hands-on experience, by joining us, you could improve your mechanical skills and learn and apply electrical and computer science skills. With the support of Innovation Wing, we plan to join competitions to test our knowledge and skills, also to learn from other teams and gain valuable experience. In 2022, the team build the system based on the rules of AUVSI SUAS 2023. The AUVSI SUAS Competition is a yearly event, designed to stimulate interest in UAS technologies and careers, and to engage students in a challenging UAS mission. SIG – Smart Elderly Walker  This project aims to develop the set of technologies to achieve convenient-to-use mobility support for daily use of the elderly. In this project, we are developing a smart elderly walker which is intended to play an active role in an elderly person’s daily life, with three fundamental functionalities that do not exist or not well supported by (smart) walkers in the market: smart walking assistance; falling prevention and support; autonomous mobility.\n",
      "The_Innovation_Wings-2.pdf:  Using designs perfected by millions of years of natural evolution, we adapt selected features into increasing effectiveness of man-made robots. We aim to establish a hub based in the Innovation Wing where this development can take root in the local community, increasing awareness and interest while promoting scientific innovation: this will be done through outreach projects, educational initiatives, as well as the continuation of various bio-inspired initiatives under BREED. SIG – HKU RoboMaster  Robomaster is a national robotics competition for university students, hosted by DJI. The project is about forming a team to design various types of smart robots which can engage in face-to-face, videogame-style battles. The preparation process involves the knowledge in the following disciplines: mechanical and hardware design, control theory application, computer vision and smart algorithm, technical management. The ultimate purpose of the project is to develop the skills, quality and team spirit of engineering students that can be beneficial in their future career.\n"
